## notation as code  
To be upfront here I don’t know how to code. I understand neither computers nor science. Certainly not ***computer science***.   
&nbsp;  
I do understand music. I think I learned to read music (Western notation, ie. what you probably think of as normal sheet music) when I was about 8, but humans have been notating music all over the world for thousands and thousands of years. (Fun facts: The earliest known sheet music is a cuneiform tablet from Sumer, circa 2000 BC. The oldest surviving *complete musical composition* is the Seikilos epitaph, found engraved on a 1st century marble tombstone in present-day Turkey.   
&nbsp;  
And the most amazing thing is that we know what this music sounds like. Because, without speaking a word of ancient Sumerian, we can *read* it!   
&nbsp;  
To me, **this is code**. A series of outwardly meaningless symbols which, when read by a knowledgeable person with proper equipment, becomes Tchaikovsky. Or Mozart. Or Bach. An open-source code that anybody in the world can “download” (read) and “run” (play,) as faithfully (or not) as they like.  
&nbsp;  
In service of my point, I composed a short waltz with six parts. And although I wrote it, it is now as separate from me as Beethoven’s 9th is from Beethoven, (theoretically) able to live on through anybody with two violins and a piano.  
&nbsp;  
So if you want to hear it, you’d better grab your instruments.  
&nbsp;  
Just kidding.
